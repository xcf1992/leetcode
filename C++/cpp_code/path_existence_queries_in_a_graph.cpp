3532. Path Existence Queries in a Graph I

You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given an integer array nums of length n sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer maxDiff.

An undirected edge exists between nodes i and j if the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most maxDiff (i.e., |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff).

You are also given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[i] = [ui, vi], determine whether there exists a path between nodes ui and vi.

Return a boolean array answer, where answer[i] is true if there exists a path between ui and vi in the ith query and false otherwise.



Example 1:
Input: n = 2, nums = [1,3], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: [true,false]
Explanation:
Query [0,0]: Node 0 has a trivial path to itself.
Query [0,1]: There is no edge between Node 0 and Node 1 because |nums[0] - nums[1]| = |1 - 3| = 2, which is greater than maxDiff.
Thus, the final answer after processing all the queries is [true, false].

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, nums = [2,5,6,8], maxDiff = 2, queries = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [false,false,true,true]
Explanation:
The resulting graph is:
Query [0,1]: There is no edge between Node 0 and Node 1 because |nums[0] - nums[1]| = |2 - 5| = 3, which is greater than maxDiff.
Query [0,2]: There is no edge between Node 0 and Node 2 because |nums[0] - nums[2]| = |2 - 6| = 4, which is greater than maxDiff.
Query [1,3]: There is a path between Node 1 and Node 3 through Node 2 since |nums[1] - nums[2]| = |5 - 6| = 1 and |nums[2] - nums[3]| = |6 - 8| = 2, both of which are within maxDiff.
Query [2,3]: There is an edge between Node 2 and Node 3 because |nums[2] - nums[3]| = |6 - 8| = 2, which is equal to maxDiff.
Thus, the final answer after processing all the queries is [false, false, true, true].


Constraints:
1 <= n == nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
0 <= maxDiff <= 105
1 <= queries.length <= 105
queries[i] == [ui, vi]
0 <= ui, vi < n

Since nums array is already sorted,
if two nodes are connected directly or indirectly,
their numbers will differ by at most maxDiff at every step.
So we can group connected nodes together while traversing once.
