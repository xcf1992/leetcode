/*
 Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to],
 reconstruct the itinerary in order.
 All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK.
 Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

 Note:
 If there are multiple valid itineraries,
 you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
 For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
 All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
 You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

 Example 1:

 Input: tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
 Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
 Example 2:

 Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
 Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
 Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it is larger in lexical order.
