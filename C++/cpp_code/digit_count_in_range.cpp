/*
1067. Digit Count in Range

Given an integer d between 0 and 9,
and two positive integers low and high as lower and upper bounds, respectively.
Return the number of times that d occurs as a digit in all integers between low and high,
including the bounds low and high.

Example 1:
Input: d = 1, low = 1, high = 13
Output: 6
Explanation:
The digit d=1 occurs 6 times in 1,10,11,12,13. Note that the digit d=1 occurs twice in the number 11.

Example 2:
Input: d = 3, low = 100, high = 250
Output: 35
Explanation:
The digit d=3 occurs 35 times in 103,113,123,130,131,...,238,239,243.

Note:
0 <= d <= 9
1 <= low <= high <= 2Ã—10^8
