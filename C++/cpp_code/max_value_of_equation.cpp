/*
1499. Max Value of Equation
https://leetcode.com/problems/max-value-of-equation/

Given an array points containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane,
sorted by the x-values,
where points[i] = [xi, yi] such that xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length.
You are also given an integer k.

Find the maximum value of the equation yi + yj + |xi - xj|
where |xi - xj| <= k and 1 <= i < j <= points.length.
It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint |xi - xj| <= k.

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.

Example 2:
Input: points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.

Constraints:
2 <= points.length <= 10^5
points[i].length == 2
-10^8 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8
0 <= k <= 2 * 10^8
points[i][0] < points[j][0] for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length
xi form a strictly increasing sequence.

Explanation
Because xi < xj,
yi + yj + |xi - xj| = (yi - xi) + (yj + xj)

So we only need to find out the maximum yi - xi.
To find out the maximum element in a sliding window,
we can use priority queue or stack.
