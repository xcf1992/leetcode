375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II
https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii/

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n.
You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong,
I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x.
You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:
n = 10, I pick 8.
First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

For each number x in range[i~j]
we do: result_when_pick_x = x + max{DP([i~x-1]), DP([x+1, j])}
–> // the max means whenever you choose a number, the feedback is always bad and therefore leads you to a worse branch.
then we get DP([i~j]) = min{xi, … ,xj}
–> // this min makes sure that you are minimizing your cost.

It takes me some time to understand the simple question “why it’s using max(dp[i][x-1], dp[x+1][j])”,
so I want to share my understanding here to help people like me.

dp[i][j] is the minimal cost to guess from range(i…j).
When you choose an x where i <= x <= j,
you may find the target number from left i…x-1,
or you may find the target number from the x+1…j,
because you don’t know which way should go,
so to guarantee you have enough money to find the target,
you need to prepare the more,
which is max(dp[i][x-1], dp[x+1][j]).
