/*
786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction

A sorted list A contains 1, plus some number of primes.
Then, for every p < q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.

What is the K-th smallest fraction considered?
Return your answer as an array of ints, where answer[0] = p and answer[1] = q.

Examples:
Input: A = [1, 2, 3, 5], K = 3
Output: [2, 5]
Explanation:
The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3.
The third fraction is 2/5.

Input: A = [1, 7], K = 1
Output: [1, 7]

Note:
A will have length between 2 and 2000.
Each A[i] will be between 1 and 30000.
K will be between 1 and A.length * (A.length - 1) / 2.

Intuition

Let under(x) be the number of fractions below x.
It's an increasing function on x, so we can binary search for the correct answer.

Algorithm

Let's binary search for x such that there are exactly K fractions below x.
At the same time, we'll record the largest such fraction seen that was still below x.

Our binary search follows a similar template as other binary searches:
we have some interval [lo, hi] and a midpoint mi = (lo + hi) / 2.0.
If the number of fractions below mi is less than K,
then we will now consider the interval [mi, hi];
otherwise we will consider the interval [lo, mi].

Our under(x) function has two objectives:
to return the number of fractions below x,
as well as the maximum such fraction below x.
To count this, we will use a sliding window approach:
for each primes[j], we'll find the largest i so that primes[i] / primes[j] < x.
These is are necessarily increasing as j (and primes[j]) increases, so this check is linear.
