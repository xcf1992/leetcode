377. Combination Sum IV
https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/

Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates,
find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
Therefore the output is 7.

Follow up:
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

The problem with negative numbers is that now the combinations could be potentially of infinite length.
Think about nums = [-1, 1] and target = 1.
We can have all sequences of arbitrary length that follow the patterns -1, 1, -1, 1, ..., -1, 1, 1
and 1, -1, 1, -1, ..., 1, -1, 1 (there are also others, of course, just to give an example).
So we should limit the length of the combination sequence,
so as to give a bound to the problem.
