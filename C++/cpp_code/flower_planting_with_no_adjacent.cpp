/*
 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent

 You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

 paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden x to garden y.

 Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

 Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

 Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.



 Example 1:

 Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
 Output: [1,2,3]
 Example 2:

 Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
 Output: [1,2,1,2]
 Example 3:

 Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
 Output: [1,2,3,4]


 Note:

 1 <= N <= 10000
 0 <= paths.size <= 20000
 No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
 It is guaranteed an answer exists.
