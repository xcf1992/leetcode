1672. Richest Customer Wealth
https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts
where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank.
Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts.
The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Example 1:
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

Example 2:
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

Example 3:
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17

Constraints:
m == accounts.length
n == accounts[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100
