/*
1143. Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings text1 and text2,
return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none)
deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
(eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.


Constraints:

1 <= text1.length <= 1000
1 <= text2.length <= 1000
The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
