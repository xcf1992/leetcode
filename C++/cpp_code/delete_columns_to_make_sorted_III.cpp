/*
960. Delete Columns to Make Sorted III

We are given an array A of N lowercase letter strings,
all of the same length.
Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices,
and for each string,
we delete all the characters in those indices.

For example,
if we have an array A = ["babca","bbazb"] and deletion indices {0, 1, 4},
then the final array after deletions is ["bc","az"].

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions,
the final array has every element (row) in lexicographic order.

For clarity, A[0] is in lexicographic order (ie. A[0][0] <= A[0][1] <= ... <= A[0][A[0].length - 1]),
A[1] is in lexicographic order (ie. A[1][0] <= A[1][1] <= ... <= A[1][A[1].length - 1]), and so on.

Return the minimum possible value of D.length.

Example 1:
Input: ["babca","bbazb"]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the final array is A = ["bc", "az"].
Both these rows are individually in lexicographic order (ie. A[0][0] <= A[0][1] and A[1][0] <= A[1][1]).
Note that A[0] > A[1] - the array A isn't necessarily in lexicographic order.

Example 2:
Input: ["edcba"]
Output: 4
Explanation: If we delete less than 4 columns, the only row won't be lexicographically sorted.

Example 3:
Input: ["ghi","def","abc"]
Output: 0
Explanation: All rows are already lexicographically sorted.

Note:
1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i].length <= 100

Take n cols as n elements, so we have an array of n elements.
=> The final array has every row in lexicographic order.
=> The elements in final state is in increasing order.
=> The final elements is a sub sequence of initial array.
=> Transform the problem to find the maximum increasing sub sequence.

Now let's talking about how to find maximum increasing subsequence.
Here we apply a O(N^2) dp solution.

dp[i] means the longest subsequence ends with i-th element.
For all j < i, if A[][j] < A[][i], then dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)

Time Complexity:
O(MN^2)

we cannot do by getting shortest subsequence from each longest increasing subsequence
cause it may happen the deleted columns are interleaved with each other
so the acutal possible remain columns could be much shorter
