1798. Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-consecutive-values-you-can-make/

You are given an integer array coins of length n which represents the n coins that you own.
The value of the ith coin is coins[i].
You can make some value x if you can choose some of your n coins such that their values sum up to x.

Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you can make with your coins starting from and including 0.
Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.

Example 1:
Input: coins = [1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
You can make 2 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
Example 2:
Input: coins = [1,1,1,4]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
- 2: take [1,1]
- 3: take [1,1,1]
- 4: take [4]
- 5: take [4,1]
- 6: take [4,1,1]
- 7: take [4,1,1,1]
You can make 8 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,4,10,3,1]
Output: 20

Constraints:
coins.length == n
1 <= n <= 4 * 104
1 <= coins[i] <= 4 * 104

Intuition
"Return the maximum number ... you can make with your coins starting from and including 0"
this equals to
"Return the minimum number that you can not make .."

Explanation
Because samll values can only discompose to samller numbers,
we sort the input array and check from the small coins.

res means the next value we want to make,
and we can already make 0,1,2,3...res-1.

We iterate the array,
If a > res, all left numbers are bigger than res,
we can not make res in all means,
so we break the loop and return res

If a <= res,
we could make from 0 to res - 1,
now with a so we can make from a to res + a - 1,
and a <= res, so our next goal becomes res + a now.
so in this case, we simply res += a
