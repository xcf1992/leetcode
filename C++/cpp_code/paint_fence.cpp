276. Paint Fence

You are painting a fence of n posts with k different colors. You must paint the posts following these rules:

Every post must be painted exactly one color.
There cannot be three or more consecutive posts with the same color.
Given the two integers n and k, return the number of ways you can paint the fence.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: All the possibilities are shown.
Note that painting all the posts red or all the posts green is invalid because there cannot be three posts in a row with the same color.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 42

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 50
1 <= k <= 105
The testcases are generated such that the answer is in the range [0, 231 - 1] for the given n and k.
