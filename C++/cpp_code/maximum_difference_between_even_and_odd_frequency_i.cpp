3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.



Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaaabbc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabcab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.


Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
