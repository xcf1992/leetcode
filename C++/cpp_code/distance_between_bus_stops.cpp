/*
1184. Distance Between Bus Stops
https://leetcode.com/problems/distance-between-bus-stops/

A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle.
We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.



Example 1:



Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.


Example 2:



Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.


Example 3:



Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4
distance.length == n
0 <= start, destination < n
0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4
