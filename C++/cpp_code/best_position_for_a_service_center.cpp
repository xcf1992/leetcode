1515. Best Position for a Service Centre
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-position-for-a-service-centre/

A delivery company wants to build a new service centre in a new city.
The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map
and wants to build the new centre in a position such that the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum.

Given an array positions where positions[i] = [xi, yi] is the position of the ith customer on the map,
return the minimum sum of the euclidean distances to all customers.

In other words, you need to choose the position of the service centre [xcentre, ycentre] such that the following formula is minimized:
Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4.00000
Explanation: As shown, you can see that choosing [xcentre, ycentre] = [1, 1] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.

Example 2:
Input: positions = [[1,1],[3,3]]
Output: 2.82843
Explanation: The minimum possible sum of distances = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2.82843

Example 3:
Input: positions = [[1,1]]
Output: 0.00000

Example 4:
Input: positions = [[1,1],[0,0],[2,0]]
Output: 2.73205
Explanation: At the first glance, you may think that locating the centre at [1, 0] will achieve the minimum sum, but locating it at [1, 0] will make the sum of distances = 3.
Try to locate the centre at [1.0, 0.5773502711] you will see that the sum of distances is 2.73205.
Be careful with the precision!

Example 5:
Input: positions = [[0,1],[3,2],[4,5],[7,6],[8,9],[11,1],[2,12]]
Output: 32.94036
Explanation: You can use [4.3460852395, 4.9813795505] as the position of the centre.

Constraints:
1 <= positions.length <= 50
positions[i].length == 2
0 <= positions[i][0], positions[i][1] <= 100

/*
The solution below is an approximation; it's accepted but may fail specific test cases. I believe that LeetCode did this on purpose so non-math solutions are accepted during the contest.

The math solution for this problem is to find the geometric median, which can be done using the Weiszfeld's algorithm. You can find many great math solutions in Discuss.

The approximation solution, however, can be adjusted to achieve the required precision. For example, you can run it several times with different factor (e.g. 1/10, 1/2, etc.), and then pick the best answer. Also, the approximation solution works for other formulas, not just distances :)

Solution
We first find the best 10x10 square to put the service center in the 100x100 grid. Then, find the best 1x1 square in the 30x30 grid (with 10x10 square from the previous step in the middle).

Continue this process, dividing the grid size (delta) by 10 till it's smaller than 10^-5.
