672. Bulb Switcher II
https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher-ii/

There is a room with n lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall.
After performing exactly m unknown operations towards buttons,
you need to return how many different kinds of status of the n lights could be.

Suppose n lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n],
function of these 4 buttons are given below:
Flip all the lights.
Flip lights with even numbers.
Flip lights with odd numbers.
Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...

Example 1:
Input: n = 1, m = 1.
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off]

Example 2:
Input: n = 2, m = 1.
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, m = 1.
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off], [off, on, on].

Note: n and m both fit in range [0, 1000].

Intuition and Algorithm

As before, the first 6 lights uniquely determine the rest of the lights.
This is because every operation that modifies the xx-th light also modifies the (x+6)(x+6)-th light,
so the xx-th light is always equal to the (x+6)(x+6)-th light.

Actually, the first 3 lights uniquely determine the rest of the sequence,
as shown by the table below for performing the operations a, b, c, d:

Light 1 = 1 + a + c + d
Light 2 = 1 + a + b
Light 3 = 1 + a + c
Light 4 = 1 + a + b + d
Light 5 = 1 + a + c
Light 6 = 1 + a + b
So that (modulo 2):

Light 4 = (Light 1) + (Light 2) + (Light 3)
Light 5 = Light 3
Light 6 = Light 2
The above justifies taking n = min(n, 3)n=min(n,3) without loss of generality.
The rest is now casework.

Let's denote the state of lights by the tuple (a, b, c)(a,b,c).
The transitions are to XOR by (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1),(1,1,1),(0,1,0),(1,0,1), or (1, 0, 0)(1,0,0).

When m = 0m=0, all the lights are on,
and there is only one state (1, 1, 1)(1,1,1).
The answer in this case is always 1.

When m = 1m=1, we could get states (0, 0, 0)(0,0,0), (1, 0, 1)(1,0,1), (0, 1, 0)(0,1,0),
or (0, 1, 1)(0,1,1).
The answer in this case is either 2, 3, 42,3,4 for n = 1, 2, 3n=1,2,3 respectively.

When m = 2m=2, we can manually check that we can get 7 states:
all of them except for (0, 1, 1)(0,1,1).
The answer in this case is either 2, 4, 72,4,7 for n = 1, 2, 3n=1,2,3 respectively.

When m = 3m=3, we can get all 8 states.
The answer in this case is either 2, 4, 82,4,8 for n = 1, 2, 3n=1,2,3 respectively.

Complexity Analysis

Time and Space Complexity: O(1)O(1). The entire program uses constants.
