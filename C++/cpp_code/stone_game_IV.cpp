1510. Stone Game IV
https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv/

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game,
with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are n stones in a pile.
On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.
Given a positive integer n.
Return True if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return False,
assuming both players play optimally.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).

Example 3:
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).

Example 4:
Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).

Example 5:
Input: n = 17
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5

Explanation
dp[i] means the result for n = i.

if there is any k that dp[i - k * k] == false,
it means we can make the other lose the game,
so we can win the game an dp[i] = true.
