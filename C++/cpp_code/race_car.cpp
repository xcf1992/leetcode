/*
818. Race Car

Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.
(Your car can go into negative positions.)

Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).
When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following:
position += speed, speed *= 2.

When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following:
if your speed is positive then speed = -1 , otherwise speed = 1.
(Your position stays the same.)

For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.
Now for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

Example 1:
Input:
target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3.

Example 2:
Input:
target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation:
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.

Note:
1 <= target <= 10000.

Dynamic Programming
Consider two general cases for number i with bit_length n.

i == 2^n-1, this case, n is the best way
2 ^ (n - 1) - 1 < i < 2^n - 1, there are two ways to arrive at i:
Use n A to arrive at 2^n - 1 first, then use R to change the direction,
by here there are n+1 operations (n A and one R), then the remaining is same as dp[2^n-1-i]

Use n-1 A to arrive at 2^(n-1)-1 first,
then R to change the direction,
use m A to go backward,
then use R to change the direction again to move forward,
by here there are n-1+2+m=n+m+1 operations (n-1 A, two R, m A),
current position is 2^(n-1)-1 - (2^m-1) = 2^(n-1)-2^m,
the remaining operations is same as dp[i-(2^(n-1)-1)+(2^m-1)]=dp[i-2^(n-1)+2^m)].

Why dp in this way?
I first think the dp way should be:
dp[i] = min(n+1+dp[2^n-1-i], n-1+2+dp[i-2^(n-1)+1])
But it's wrong, look at the (n-1) A case, we do A for (n-1) times, then do two R,
then the situation is the same as dp[i-2^(n-1)+1].
This can be larger than the actual min operations since, there may be redundant R operations,
we can combine RR operation with the remaining (2^(n-1)-1) to i path.
So we use m to go backward between the two R operations and count the remaining (2^(n-1)-2^m) to i path to include the combining situation.

For example: target = 5

The right answer should be AARARAA, positions: 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 5
But if we use the above formula, the answer is AA (0->3) RR (make speed at 1 again) AARA (3->5)

We can move the last A to the middle of RR, so that we save an operation. That's where the combine can happen.
So we do dp by adding m A between the RR and add the # operations for remaining distance.

If you have better explanation, please let me know. Thanks.
