3068. Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values

There exists an undirected tree with n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1.
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of length n - 1,
where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the tree.
You are also given a positive integer k,
and a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers nums of length n,
where nums[i] represents the value of the node numbered i.

Alice wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be maximum,
for which Alice can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero) on the tree:

Choose any edge [u, v] connecting the nodes u and v, and update their values as follows:
nums[u] = nums[u] XOR k
nums[v] = nums[v] XOR k
Return the maximum possible sum of the values Alice can achieve by performing the operation any number of times.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,1], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 6 using a single operation:
- Choose the edge [0,2]. nums[0] and nums[2] become: 1 XOR 3 = 2, and the array nums becomes: [1,2,1] -> [2,2,2].
The total sum of values is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
It can be shown that 6 is the maximum achievable sum of values.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,3], k = 7, edges = [[0,1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: Alice can achieve the maximum sum of 9 using a single operation:
- Choose the edge [0,1]. nums[0] becomes: 2 XOR 7 = 5 and nums[1] become: 3 XOR 7 = 4, and the array nums becomes: [2,3] -> [5,4].
The total sum of values is 5 + 4 = 9.
It can be shown that 9 is the maximum achievable sum of values.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7], k = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]]
Output: 42
Explanation: The maximum achievable sum is 42 which can be achieved by Alice performing no operations.

Constraints:
2 <= n == nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= k <= 109
0 <= nums[i] <= 109
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1
The input is generated such that edges represent a valid tree.

/*
For whom wondering why edges are not used, note that double XOR returns itself.
Since it is a undirected tree, every node can be connected by a path, let's say 'x-a-b-c-y'.
Do XOR for every edge results: 2 XOR for a, b, c and 1 XOR for x, y,
which coincides to a single XOR of x-y as they are directly connected.

Hence, the problem does not depend on the specific edge structure — only on the fact that the graph is connected.

All you need to decide is:

Which nodes to XOR with k, under the condition that the number of XORed nodes is even.

That’s it!
This turns the problem into:

From nums, choose an even number of elements to replace with num ^ k instead of num, maximizing the total sum.

dp[0]	The maximum total sum you can get after considering all numbers so far,
when you’ve chosen an even number of those numbers to apply the XOR operation (num ^ k).
dp[1]	The maximum total sum you can get after considering all numbers so far,
when you’ve chosen an odd number of those numbers to apply the XOR operation (num ^ k).
