/*
959. Regions Cut By Slashes
In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares,
each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.
These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)

Return the number of regions.

Example 1:

Input:
[
" /",
"/ "
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 2:

Input:
[
" /",
"  "
]
Output: 1
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 3:

Input:
[
"\\/",
"/\\"
]
Output: 4
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 4:

Input:
[
"/\\",
"\\/"
]
Output: 5
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 5:

Input:
[
"//",
"/ "
]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.

/*
Split a cell in to 4 parts like this.
We give it a number top is 1, right is 2, bottom is 3 left is 4.

Two adjacent parts in different cells are contiguous regions.
In case '/', top and left are contiguous, botton and right are contiguous.
In case '\\', top and right are contiguous, bottom and left are contiguous.
In case ' ', all 4 parts are contiguous.

Congratulation.
Now you have another problem of counting the number of islands.

DFS will be good enough to solve it.
As I did in 947.Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column
I solve it with union find.

Good luck and have fun.
