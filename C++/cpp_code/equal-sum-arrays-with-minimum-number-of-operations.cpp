1775. Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations
https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-sum-arrays-with-minimum-number-of-operations/

You are given two arrays of integers nums1 and nums2, possibly of different lengths.
The values in the arrays are between 1 and 6, inclusive.

In one operation, you can change any integer's value in any of the arrays to any value between 1 and 6, inclusive.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of values in nums1 equal to the sum of values in nums2.
Return -1​​​​​ if it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6], nums2 = [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can make the sums of nums1 and nums2 equal with 3 operations. All indices are 0-indexed.
- Change nums2[0] to 6. nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6], nums2 = [6,1,2,2,2,2].
- Change nums1[5] to 1. nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,1], nums2 = [6,1,2,2,2,2].
- Change nums1[2] to 2. nums1 = [1,2,2,4,5,1], nums2 = [6,1,2,2,2,2].
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], nums2 = [6]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to decrease the sum of nums1 or to increase the sum of nums2 to make them equal.
Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [6,6], nums2 = [1]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can make the sums of nums1 and nums2 equal with 3 operations. All indices are 0-indexed.
- Change nums1[0] to 2. nums1 = [2,6], nums2 = [1].
- Change nums1[1] to 2. nums1 = [2,2], nums2 = [1].
- Change nums2[0] to 4. nums1 = [2,2], nums2 = [4].

Constraints:
1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105
1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 6

        //      2. decrease some elements to '1' in nums2.

        // way ) this operation increases s1 by '6 - x', (diff = s2 - s1) (as s1 increases then diff decreases).

        for (int& x : nums2)

        // similarly, x - 1 signifies how much decrement it does if we change a element 'x' to '1' in nums2 in one
        // operation. (2nd way) this operation decreases s2 by 'x - 1', (diff = s2 - s1) (as s2 decreases then diff
        // decreases).

        sort(arr.rbegin(), arr.rend());
        // sorting in desending order to pick the most valuable operation that decreases the 'diff'. (Yes, Greedy)
