660. Remove 9

Start from integer 1, remove any integer that contains 9 such as 9, 19, 29...
So now, you will have a new integer sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, ...
Given a positive integer n, you need to return the n-th integer after removing.
Note that 1 will be the first integer.

Example 1:
Input: 9
Output: 10
Hint: n will not exceed 9 x 10^8.

/*
Let's write the first numbers and try to notice a pattern. Those numbers are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
...
80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88,
100, 101, 102, ...
These numbers look exactly like all base-9 numbers!

Indeed, every base-9 number is a number in this sequence, and every number in this sequence is a base-9 number.
Both this sequence and the sequence of all base-9 numbers are in increasing order.
The answer is therefore just the n-th base-9 number.
==============-=============
Think it this way:
you're asked to count n numbers in number system where only digits 0..8 are used(base 9).
Now this solution just does that,
but keeps base(s in code) 10 as answer required is in decimal.
This method will not work if we modify problem to remove 8 or say 5.
