1705. Maximum Number of Eaten Apples
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-eaten-apples/

There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days.
On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days,
that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten.
On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.

You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away).
Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.
Given two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.

Example 1:
Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
Example 2:
Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.

Constraints:
apples.length == n
days.length == n
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104
days[i] = 0 if and only if apples[i] = 0.
