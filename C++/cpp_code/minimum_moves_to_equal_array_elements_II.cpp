462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal,
where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]

/*
In the previous approach,
we went for finding the median after sorting and then calculated the number of moves required.
But, if we observe properly, we'll find that if the array is sorted,
we can do the same task without actually finding the median or the number k to which we need to settle at the end.
To proceed with this, let's look at the maximum(max) and the minimum numbers(min) in the array,
which currently lie at its extreme positions. We know, at the end, both these numbers should be equalized to k.

For the number max, the number of moves required to do this is given by max - k. Similarly,
for the number min, the number of moves is given by k - min.
Thus, the total number of moves for both max and min is given by max - k + (k - min) = max - min,
which is independent of the number k. Thus, we can continue now,
with the next maximum and the next minimum number in the array, until the complete array is exhausted.
