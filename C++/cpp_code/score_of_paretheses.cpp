/*
856. Score of Parentheses
https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-parentheses/

Given a balanced parentheses string S,
compute the score of the string based on the following rule:

() has score 1
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.

Example 1:
Input: "()"
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: "(())"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: "()()"
Output: 2

Example 4:
Input: "(()(()))"
Output: 6

Note:
S is a balanced parentheses string, containing only ( and ).
2 <= S.length <= 50

Intuition

The final sum will be a sum of powers of 2,
as every core (a substring (), with score 1) will have it's score multiplied by 2 for each exterior set of parentheses that contains that core.

Algorithm

Keep track of the balance of the string,
as defined in Approach #1.
For every ) that immediately follows a (, the answer is 1 << balance,
as balance is the number of exterior set of parentheses that contains this core.

cur record the score at the current layer level.

If we meet '(',
we push the current score to stack,
enter the next inner layer level,
and reset cur = 0.

If we meet ')',
the cur score will be doubled and will be at least 1.
We exit the current layer level,
and set cur = stack.pop() + cur

Complexity: O(N) time and O(N) space
