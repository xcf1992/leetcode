3350. Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection II

Given an array nums of n integers, your task is to find the maximum value of k for which there exist two adjacent
subarrays of length k each, such that both subarrays are strictly increasing. Specifically, check if there are two
subarrays of length k starting at indices a and b (a < b), where:

Both subarrays nums[a..a + k - 1] and nums[b..b + k - 1] are strictly increasing.
The subarrays must be adjacent, meaning b = a + k.
Return the maximum possible value of k.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The subarray starting at index 2 is [7, 8, 9], which is strictly increasing.
The subarray starting at index 5 is [2, 3, 4], which is also strictly increasing.
These two subarrays are adjacent, and 3 is the maximum possible value of k for which two such adjacent strictly
increasing subarrays exist. Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,6,7]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The subarray starting at index 0 is [1, 2], which is strictly increasing.
The subarray starting at index 2 is [3, 4], which is also strictly increasing.
These two subarrays are adjacent, and 2 is the maximum possible value of k for which two such adjacent strictly
increasing subarrays exist.


Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
