1140. Stone Game II
https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-ii/

Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.
There are a number of piles arranged in a row,
and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].
The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.
Initially, M = 1.

On each player's turn,
that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles,
where 1 <= X <= 2M.
Then, we set M = max(M, X).

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally,
return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.

Example 1:
Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:
If Alex takes one pile at the beginning,
Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again.
Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total.
If Alex takes two piles at the beginning,
then Lee can take all three piles left.
In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total.
So we return 10 since it's larger.

Constraints:
1 <= piles.length <= 100
1 <= piles[i] <= 10 ^ 4
