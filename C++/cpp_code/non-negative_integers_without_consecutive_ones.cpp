600. Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones

Given a positive integer n,
find the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n,
whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 5
Explanation:
Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
0 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 10
3 : 11
4 : 100
5 : 101
Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule.

Note:
1 <= n <= 109

This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming.
Let a[i] be the number of binary strings of length i which do not contain any two consecutive 1â€™s and which end in 0.
Similarly, let b[i] be the number of such strings which end in 1.
We can append either 0 or 1 to a string ending in 0,
but we can only append 0 to a string ending in 1.

This yields the recurrence relation:
a[i] = a[i - 1] + b[i - 1]
b[i] = a[i - 1]
The base cases of above recurrence are a[1] = b[1] = 1.
The total number of strings of length i is just a[i] + b[i].

        the count of valid number has n bit, some of them are bigger than num we want and we need to subtract them below

        if bit[i] == 1
            if bit[i + 1] == 0, there's no solutions in res that is larger than num, we go further into smaller bit and subtract.
            if bit[i + 1] == 1, we know in those res solutions it won't have any consecutive ones.
              when bit[i + 1] == 1, in one[i + 1], the i-th bit in valid solutions must be 0,
              which are all smaller than 'num', we don't need to check smaller bits and subtract, so we break the for loop.
        if bit[i] == 0
            if bit[i + 1] == 1, there's no solutions in res that is larger than num, we go further into smaller bit and subtract.
            if bit[i + 1] == 0, we know zero[i + 1] includes solutions of i-th == 0 (00***) and i-th bit == 1 (01***),
              we know the i-th bit of num is 0, so we need to subtract all the 01*** solutions
              because it is larger than num. Therefore, one[i] is subtracted from res.
