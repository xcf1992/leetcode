/*
518. Coin Change 2

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money.
Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount.
You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

Note:
You can assume that
0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

Example 1:
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

Example 2:
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

Example 3:
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
Output: 1

This is a 2D dp problem,
dp[i][j] means combinations using coin 0, 1 ... i to build amount j
it can be get by:
1. do not use coin i, which is dp[i - 1][j]
2. use at least one coin i, which is dp[i][j - coins[i]]

later we can find that dp[i][j] only relies on dp[i - 1][j] and dp[i][j - coins[i]]
so we can actually only use one array to solve the problem
