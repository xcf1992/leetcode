256. Paint House
https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/

There are a row of n houses,
each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green.
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.
You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red;
costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:
Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
