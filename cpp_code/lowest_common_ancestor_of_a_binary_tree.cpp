236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:
root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

Example 1:
                                            3
                            5                               1
                    6               2                   0       8
                                7       4
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Note:
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

If either p or q matches is the root, report
the presence by returning root (Note that if a key is
ancestor of other, then the ancestor key becomes LCA
If both of the above calls return Non-nullptr, then one key
is present in once subtree and other is present in other,
So this node is the LCA
