1168. Optimize Water Distribution in a Village

There are n houses in a village.
We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i],
or pipe in water from another well to it.
The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes,
where each pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost] represents the cost to connect house1 and house2 together using a pipe.
Connections are bidirectional.

Find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10000
wells.length == n
0 <= wells[i] <= 10^5
1 <= pipes.length <= 10000
1 <= pipes[i][0], pipes[i][1] <= n
0 <= pipes[i][2] <= 10^5
pipes[i][0] != pipes[i][1]

/*
What if we model this problem as a graph problem?
A house is a node and a pipe is a weighted edge.
How to represent building wells in the graph model?
Add a virtual node, connect it to houses with edges weighted by the costs to build wells in these houses.
The problem is now reduced to a Minimum Spanning Tree problem.
