1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions
https://leetcode.com/problems/change-minimum-characters-to-satisfy-one-of-three-conditions/

You are given two strings a and b that consist of lowercase letters.
In one operation, you can change any character in a or b to any lowercase letter.

Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:
Every letter in a is strictly less than every letter in b in the alphabet.
Every letter in b is strictly less than every letter in a in the alphabet.
Both a and b consist of only one distinct letter.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.

Example 1:
Input: a = "aba", b = "caa"
Output: 2
Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:
1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).
Example 2:
Input: a = "dabadd", b = "cda"
Output: 3
Explanation: The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".

Constraints:
1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105
a and b consist only of lowercase letters.

Count the frequcy of each character in a and b.
Find the most common characters most_common = max((c1 + c2).values()),
this help meet the condition 3 with m + n - most_common.

The we calculate the accumulate prefix sum of count.
This help finding the number of smaller characters in O(1) time.

Enumerate the character i a,b,c...x,y,
To meet condition 1,
which is a < b,
we need (m - c1[i]) + c2[i]

To meet condition 2,
which is a > b,
we need n - c2[i] + c1[i]


Complexity
Time O(m + n)
Space O(26)

For those who are confusing about the part res = min(res, m - c1[i] + c2[i]),
this post has detailed explanation:
https://leetcode.com/problems/change-minimum-characters-to-satisfy-one-of-three-conditions/discuss/1032042/Java-Detailed-Explanation-Find-the-Boundary-Letter

Here c1 and c2 are not just counters for each char,
they are updated to counters for all chars less than or equal to i.

Consider the character i to be the boundary separating a and b,
now we need to make all chars in a less than or equal to i,
ops count is m - c1[i] which is just the count of count of chars greater than i in a.
We also need to make all chars in b greater than i,
ops count is c2[i] which is just the count of chars less than or equal to i in b.
