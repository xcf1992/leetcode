 1013. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

 In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

 Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.
 Formally, we want the number of indices i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 Example 1:

 Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
 Output: 3
 Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
 (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
 (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
 (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
 Example 2:

 Input: [60,60,60]
 Output: 3
 Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.


 Note:

 1 <= time.length <= 60000
 1 <= time[i] <= 500
