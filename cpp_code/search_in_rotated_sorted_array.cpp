33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

1- take the middle and compare with target, if matches return.
2- if middle is bigger than left side, it means left is sorted
    2a- if [left] < target < [middle] then do recursion with left, middle - 1 (right)
    2b- left side is sorted, but target not in here, search on right side middle + 1 (left), right
3- if middle is less than right side, it means right is sorted
    3a- if [middle] < target < [right] then do recursion with middle + 1 (left), right
    3b- right side is sorted, but target not in here, search on left side left, middle -1 (right)
