/*
666. Path Sum IV

If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5,
then this tree can be represented by a list of three-digits integers.

For each integer in this list:

The hundreds digit represents the depth D of this node, 1 <= D <= 4.
The tens digit represents the position P of this node in the level it belongs to,
1 <= P <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
The units digit represents the value V of this node, 0 <= V <= 9.


Given a list of ascending three-digits integers representing a binary with the depth smaller than 5.
You need to return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

Example 1:

Input: [113, 215, 221]
Output: 12
Explanation:
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
   / \
  5   1

The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.


Example 2:

Input: [113, 221]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
     \
      1

The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.
