/*
321. Create Maximum Number

Given two arrays of length m and n with digits 0-9 representing two numbers.
Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two.
The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.
Return an array of the k digits.

Note:
You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.

Example 1:
Input:
nums1 = [3, 4, 6, 5]
nums2 = [9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3]
k = 5
Output:
[9, 8, 6, 5, 3]

Example 2:
Input:
nums1 = [6, 7]
nums2 = [6, 0, 4]
k = 5
Output:
[6, 7, 6, 0, 4]

Example 3:
Input:
nums1 = [3, 9]
nums2 = [8, 9]
k = 3
Output:
[9, 8, 9]

Suppose nums1 = [3, 4, 6, 5],
nums2 = [9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3],
the maximum number you can create from nums1 is [6, 5] with length 2.
For nums2, it's [9, 8, 3] with length 3.
Merging the two sequence, we have [9, 8, 6, 5, 3],
which is the max number we can create from two arrays without length constraint.
If the required length k<=5, we can simply trim the result to required length from front.
For instance, if k=3, then [9, 8, 6] is the result.

Suppose we need to create max number with length 2 from num = [4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 6, 0, 8].
The simple way is to use a stack,
first we push 4 and have stack [4],
then comes 5 > 4, we pop 4 and push 5,
stack becomes [5], 3 < 5, we push 3, stack becomes [5, 3].
Now we have the required length 2,
but we need to keep going through the array in case a larger number comes, 2 < 3,
we discard it instead of pushing it because the stack already grows to required size 2. 1 < 3,
we discard it. 6 > 3, we pop 3, since 6 > 5 and there are still elements left,
we can continue to pop 5 and push 6, the stack becomes [6], since 0 < 6,
we push 0, the stack becomes [6, 0], the stack grows to required length again.
Since 8 > 0, we pop 0, although 8 > 6, we can't continue to pop 6 since there is only one number,
which is 8, left, if we pop 6 and push 8, we can't get to length 2, so we push 8 directly, the stack becomes [6, 8].

In the basic idea, we mentioned trying all possible length i.
If we create max number for different i from scratch each time,
that would be a waste of time. Suppose num = [4, 9, 3, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6],
we need to create max number with length from 1 to 8. For i==8,
result is the original array. For i==7, we need to drop 1 number from array,
since 9 > 4, we drop 4, the result is [9, 3, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6]. For i==6,
we need to drop 1 more number, 3 < 9, skip, 2 < 3, skip, 1 < 2, skip, 8 > 1,
we drop 1, the result is [9, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6]. For i==5, we need to drop 1 more,
but this time, we needn't check from beginning, during last scan,
we already know [9, 3, 2] is monotonically non-increasing, so we check 8 directly,
since 8 > 2, we drop 2, the result is [9, 3, 8, 7, 6]. For i==4, we start with 8, 8 > 3,
we drop 3, the result is [9, 8, 7, 6]. For i==3, we start with 8, 8 < 9, skip, 7 < 8, skip, 6 < 7, skip,
by now, we've got maximum number we can create from num without length constraint.
So from now on, we can drop a number from the end each time. The result is [9, 8, 7],
For i==2, we drop last number 7 and have [9, 8]. For i==1, we drop last number 8 and have [9].

it is easy to solve problem if nums1.size() + nums2.size() == k
 so we split the problem into 3 subproblems:
 1. get max sub array from nums1 of length i
 2. get max sub array from nums2 of length k - i
 3. get max merge arrary from maxsub1 and maxsub2
 4. get max merge array of length k
