406. Queue Reconstruction by Height
https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue.
Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k),
where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person
who have a height greater than or equal to h.
Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

Example
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
