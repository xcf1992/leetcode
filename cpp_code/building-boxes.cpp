1739. Building Boxes
https://leetcode.com/problems/building-boxes/

You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length,
and height of the room are all equal to n units.
You are asked to place n boxes in this room
where each box is a cube of unit side length.
There are however some rules to placing the boxes:

You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
If box x is placed on top of the box y,
then each side of the four vertical sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.
Given an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
Example 2:
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the four boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
Example 3:
Input: n = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the ten boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the back side.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 109

First, we try some examples:

1 box -> 1

4 boxes -> 1 + (1 + 2)

10 boxes -> 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 + 3)

...

n boxes -> 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + ... + ?

If n could write in such form:

cur = 1 + (1 + 2) + ... + (1 + 2 + ... + j)

Then, it is clear that the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor is (1 + 2 + ... + j)

So, let's try to find the maximum j that cur < n:

int cur = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
while(cur < n) {
    ++j;
    i += j;
    cur += i;
}
If cur equals n, then just return i.

Then we try to build boxes like this:

image

cur = 1 + 3 + 6 ... + i + (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + j)

We now try to find min j that cur >= n.

while(cur < n) {
	++j;
	cur += j;
}
For example:

If n = 14

We first find that 10 = 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 + 3)

Then we try to find min j that 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 + 3) + (1 + 2 + ... + j) >= n, like the way we build in picture above.

In this case, 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 3) = 16 >= 14 = n, so j is 3

Then the final result is i+j
