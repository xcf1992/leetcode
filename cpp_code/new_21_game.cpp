837. New 21 Game
https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.
During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.
Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.
What is the probability that she has N or less points?

Example 1:
Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.

Example 2:
Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.

Example 3:
Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
Output: 0.73278

Note:
0 <= K <= N <= 10000
1 <= W <= 10000

Sliding window + DP
Running Time: O(N)

Define dp[i] = probability of getting i points
Optimal Substructure:

dp[x] = 1/W * dp[x-1] + 1/W * dp[x-2] + 1/W * dp[x-3] + ... + 1/W * dp[x-W]
Or: dp[x] = 1/W * (dp[x-1] + dp[x-2] + dp[x-3] + ... + dp[x-W])
So with dp[0]=1, our base case, we can keep the running_sum = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2] + dp[x-3] + ... + dp[x-W] to calculate dp[x].

Note: When x >= K, Alice stops drawing numbers. So no y > x can be formed from x.
So we don't include dp[x] into the running_sum when x >= K.

the transition equation dp[i] = (dp[i - W] + dp[i - W + 1] + ... + dp[i - 1]) / W
could be simplified to dp[i] = (sum[i - 1] - sum[i - W - 1]) / W.

dp[i] = (sum[i - 1] - sum[i - W - 1]) / W
sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + dp[i]
=> sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + (sum[i - 1] - sum[i - W - 1]) / W

Furthermore, if we use dp[i] to directly represent the sum[i],
we can get dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (dp[i - 1] - dp[i - W - 1]) / W.
This equation takes us to the final O(K + W) solution. Just take care with the beginning and the end of the array.

The maximum result one can get is K + W - 1, since if one get K points already he will gain any point anymore
and if N >= K + W - 1 then it will always succeed
so to caculate Probability(X) = Sum(Probability(X - i)), while i >= 1, i <= W and X - i >= 0 and X - i < K, since we
will stop when X - i >= K
the final result is Sum(Probability(j)), j >= K, j<= N
the naive implementation is below. But it exceeds time limit
