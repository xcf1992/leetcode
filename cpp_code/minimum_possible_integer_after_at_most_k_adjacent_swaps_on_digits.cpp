1505. Minimum Possible Integer After at Most K Adjacent Swaps On Digits
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-possible-integer-after-at-most-k-adjacent-swaps-on-digits/

Given a string num representing the digits of a very large integer and an integer k.
You are allowed to swap any two adjacent digits of the integer at most k times.
Return the minimum integer you can obtain also as a string.

Example 1:
Input: num = "4321", k = 4
Output: "1342"
Explanation: The steps to obtain the minimum integer from 4321 with 4 adjacent swaps are shown.

Example 2:
Input: num = "100", k = 1
Output: "010"
Explanation: It's ok for the output to have leading zeros, but the input is guaranteed not to have any leading zeros.

Example 3:
Input: num = "36789", k = 1000
Output: "36789"
Explanation: We can keep the number without any swaps.

Example 4:
Input: num = "22", k = 22
Output: "22"

Example 5:
Input: num = "9438957234785635408", k = 23
Output: "0345989723478563548"

Constraints:
1 <= num.length <= 30000
num contains digits only and doesn't have leading zeros.
1 <= k <= 10^9

A hard question = Lots of observation + data structures

Let's figure out observations and then find out data structure to implement them.

Observation 0: Well, we know that if we could get smallest digit to the left, then we will be able to make number smaller than we currently have. In that sense, a sorted number(Ascending) will already be smallest.

So, let's take pen and paper and try to find smallest number we can form for this:

"4321", k = 4

So, let's try to move 1 to left most postion. From now on, I'll call the current digit we are moving to left as d:
"4321", k = 4
"4312", k = 3
"4132", k = 2
"1432", k = 1
Hmm, we can clearly observe:

Observation 1: when we move a digit to left, other digit are shifted to right. i.e 432 got shifted to right by 1.

But, wait. What if there was another digit to right of d?
"43219", k = 4
"43129", k = 3
"41329", k = 2
"14329", k = 1

Well, location of 9 didn't change. Therefore, we can make some correction to our above observation.

Corrected observation 1: Only digits to the left of d get their position shifted.

Alright, what's next?

But what if the k was really small and we couldn't move 1 to left most?
"43219", k = 2
"43129", k = 1
"41329", k = 0

Hmm, something is fishy, we clearly didn't reach smallest number here. Smallest for k=2 would be 24319.

We can observe here, that we should choose smallest d that is in the reach of k.

Observation 2: Choose first smallest d that is in reach of k.

If we combine all the observation, we can see that we will iterate from left to right and try to place digits 0 through 9.
Let's work through a bigger example:

"9438957234785635408", k = 23

We will start from left. Let's try to place 0 here. 0 is within reach of k, 0 is 17 shifts away to right. So, we will get:
"0943895723478563548", k = 6

Observe that all the number got shifted to right except the once to the right of d (8, here).

Now, let's move to next position:
Let's try to place 0 here, again. But wait, we don't 0 left, so try 1, which is not there also. So let's try 2, 2 is 8 distance away from this position. 8 > k, so we cannot choose 2. Let's try 3, 3 is 2 distance away. 2 < k, therefore let's choose 3.

"0394895723478563548", k = 4

and we can continue like this.

For observation 1, to calculate the correct number of shifts, we will need to also store how many elements before d already shifted. We will use segment tree for this.
For observation 2, We will use queue to choose latest occurence of each digit.
