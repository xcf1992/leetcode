790. Domino and Tromino Tiling
https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/

We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape.
These shapes may be rotated.

XX  <- domino

XX  <- "L" tromino
X

Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board?
Return your answer modulo 10^9  +  7.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile.
Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board
such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

Example:
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY

Note:
N will be in range [1, 1000].

Here is my understanding of why dp[n] = dp[n-1]  +  dp[n-2]  +  dp[n-3] * 2  +  ... dp[0] * 2:
For all f(n-1), it can be transformed to f(n) by appending a domino |, hence f(n - 1) * 1.

For all f(n - 2), though f(2) contains 2 cases: = and or,
the or case was covered by f(n - 1) plus |,

so literally there is only one distinct way to transform f(n-2) to f(n), hence f(n - 2) * 1.

For all f(n - i) where i > 2, all the ways complementing them to f(n) by dominos
(either horizontal or vertical domino) have been covered by f(n - 1) and f(n - 2)

hence the only distinct way to transform them is appending trimino or combination of trimino and domino.
And there are always only 2 ways to do this (as demonstrated in the picture).

dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2] + 2*(dp[n-3] + ... + d[0])
= dp[n-1] + dp[n-2] + dp[n-3] + dp[n-3] + 2*(dp[n-4] + ... + d[0])
= dp[n-1] + dp[n-3] + (dp[n-2] + dp[n-3] + 2*(dp[n-4] + ... + d[0]))
= dp[n-1] + dp[n-3] + dp[n-1]
= 2 * dp[n-1] + dp[n-3]
