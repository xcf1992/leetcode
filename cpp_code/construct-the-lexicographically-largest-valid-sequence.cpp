1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-lexicographically-largest-valid-sequence/

Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.
The distance between two numbers on the sequence,
a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence.
It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length)
if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b.
For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6]
because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: [3,1,2,3,2]
Explanation: [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 20
