/*
 * Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:
 *    Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
 *    "+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
 *    "D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
 *    "C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
 * Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.
 * You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.
