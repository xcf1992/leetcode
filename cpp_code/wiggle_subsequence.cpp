376. Wiggle Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/

A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence
if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative.
The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative.
A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative.
In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences,
the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers,
return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence.
A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence,
leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Examples:
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.

Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2

We call this a subsequence of type U.

                If nums[i] > nums[i-1], then we can use nums[i] to make a longer subsequence of type U
                Proof: We consider a subsequence of type D in {0,...,i-1} (its length is down[i-1]).
                Let N be the last number of this subsequence.
                - If nums[i] > N, then we can add nums[i] to the subsequence and it gives us a longer
                valid subsequence of type U.
                - If nums[i] <= N, then:
                (1) N cannot be nums[i-1], because nums[i-1] < nums[i] <= N i.e. nums[i-1] < N
                (2) We can replace N with nums[i-1] (we still have a valid
                subsequence of type D since N >= nums[i] > nums[i-1] i.e. N > nums[i-1]),
                and then add nums[i] to the subsequence, and we have a longer subsequence of type U.
                Therefore up[i] = down[i-1] + 1

                There is no gain in using nums[i] to make a longer subsequence of type D.
                Proof: Let N be the last number of a subsequence of type U
                in {0,...,i-1}.
                Assume we can use nums[i] to make a longer subsequence of type D. Then:
                (1) N cannot be nums[i-1], otherwise we would not be able to use nums[i]
                to make a longer subsequence of type D as nums[i] > nums[i-1]
                (2) Necessarily nums[i] < N, and therefore nums[i-1] < N since nums[i-1] < nums[i].
                But this means that we could have used nums[i-1] already to make a longer
                subsequence of type D.
                So even if we can use nums[i], there is no gain in using it, so we keep the old value of
                down (down[i] = down[i-1])

                newUp = down + 1;
                newDown = down;
            }
            else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                newDown = up + 1;
                newUp = up;
