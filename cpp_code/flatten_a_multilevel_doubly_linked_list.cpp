430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers,
it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list.
These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on,
to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list.
You are given the head of the first level of the list.

Example:
Input:
1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
        |
        7---8---9---10--NULL
            |
            11--12--NULL
Output:
1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
Explanation for the above example:

Given the following multilevel doubly linked list:
We should return the following flattened doubly linked list:
