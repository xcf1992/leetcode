/*
483. Smallest Good Base

For an integer n, we call k>=2 a good base of n,
if all digits of n base k are 1.
Now given a string representing n,
you should return the smallest good base of n in string format.

Example 1:
Input: "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.

Example 2:
Input: "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.

Example 3:
Input: "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.

Note:
The range of n is [3, 10^18].
The string representing n is always valid and will not have leading zeros.

First things first. Let's see the math behind it.

From given information, we can say one thing- Numbers will be of form-

n = k^m + k^(m-1) + ... + k + 1
=> n-1 = k^m + k^(m-1) + ... + k
=> n-1 = k (k^(m-1) + k^(m-2) + ... + k + 1) ...... [1]

Also, from n = k^m + k^(m-1) + ... + k + 1, we can say,
n-k^m = k^(m-1) + k^(m-2) + ... + k + 1 ...... [2]

from [1] and [2],

n-1 = k (n - k^m)
=>k^(m+1) = nk - n + 1

if you shuffle sides you will end up getting following form,

(k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1) = n .... [3]

Also from [1] note that, (n - 1) must be divisible by k.

We know that, n = k^m + k^(m-1) + ... + k + 1

=> n > k^m
=> m-th root of n > k .... [4]

[EDIT] -->

With inputs from @StefanPochmann we can also say, from binomial thorem, n = k^m + ... + 1 < (k+1)^m .... [5]
Therefore, k+1 > m-th root of n > k. .... from [4] and [5]
Thus ⌊m-th root of n⌋ is the only candidate that needs to be tested. [6]

<--

So our number should satisfy this equation where k will be our base and m will be (number of 1s - 1)

This brings us to the search problem where we need to find k and m.

Linear search from 1 to n does not work. it gives us TLE. So it leaves us with performing some optimization on search space.

From [6] we know that the only candidate that needs to be tested is, ⌊m-th root of n⌋

We also know that the smallest base is 2 so we can find our m must be between 2 and log2n else m is (n-1) [7]

That brings me to the code:

/*
The input can be stored in a long long int,
here I use unsigned long long int for a larger range.
We need to find k, for 1+k^1+k^2+k^3+...+k^d=n.
The smallest possible base is k=2,
with has the longest possible representation, i.e., largest d.
So, to find the smallest base means to find the longest possible representation "11111....1" based on k.
As n <= 10^18, so n < (1<<62).

We iterate the length of the representation from 62 to 2 (2 can always be valid, with base=n-1),
and check whether a given length can be valid.

For a given length d, we use binary search to check whether there is a base k which satisfies 1 + k^1 + k^2 + ... + k^d=n.
The left limit is 1, and the right limit is pow(n,1/d)+1, i.e., the d th square root of n. The code is shown below.
