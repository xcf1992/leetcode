/*
435. Non-overlapping Intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

Given a collection of intervals,
find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:
You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

Example 1:
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:
Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3:
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]
Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.
