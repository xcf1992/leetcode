1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid/

Given a m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit
if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:
1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])
Notice that there could be some invalid signs on the cells of the grid which points outside the grid.

You will initially start at the upper left cell (0,0).
A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell (0,0)
and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid.
The valid path doesn't have to be the shortest.

You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1.
You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.

Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You will start at point (0, 0).
The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)
The total cost = 3.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,1,3],[3,2,2],[1,1,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You can follow the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,2],[4,3]]
Output: 1

Example 4:
Input: grid = [[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 3

Example 5:
Input: grid = [[4]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100

Intuition
One observation is that, (not sure if it's obvious)
we can greedily explore the grid.
We will never detour the path to a node that we can already reach.

In the view of graph,
the fleche indicates a directed edge of weight = 0.
The distance between all neighbours are at most 1.
Now we want to find out the minimum distance between top-left and bottom-right.

Explanation
Find out all reachable nodes without changing anything.
Save all new visited nodes to a queue bfs.
Now iterate the queue
3.1 For each node, try changing it to all 3 other direction
3.2 Save the new reachable and not visited nodes to the queue.
3.3 repeat step 3

Complexity
Time O(NM)
Space O(NM)
