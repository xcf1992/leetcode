497. Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles
https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles/

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects,
write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates.
A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles.
ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
1 <= rects.length <= 100
pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
pick is called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input:
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output:
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
Example 2:

Input:
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output:
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles rects. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
