656. Coin Path
Given an array A (index starts at 1) consisting of N integers: A1, A2, ..., AN and an integer B.
The integer B denotes that from any place (suppose the index is i) in the array A,
you can jump to any one of the place in the array A indexed i+1, i+2, …, i+B if this place can be jumped to.

Also, if you step on the index i, you have to pay Ai coins.
If Ai is -1, it means you can’t jump to the place indexed i in the array.

Now, you start from the place indexed 1 in the array A,
and your aim is to reach the place indexed N using the minimum coins.
You need to return the path of indexes (starting from 1 to N)
in the array you should take to get to the place indexed N using minimum coins.

If there are multiple paths with the same cost, return the lexicographically smallest such path.

If it's not possible to reach the place indexed N then you need to return an empty array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,4,-1,2], 2
Output: [1,3,5]


Example 2:

Input: [1,2,4,-1,2], 1
Output: []


Note:

Path Pa1, Pa2, ..., Pan is lexicographically smaller than Pb1, Pb2, ..., Pbm,
if and only if at the first i where Pai and Pbi differ, Pai < Pbi;
when no such i exists, then n < m.

A1 >= 0.
A2, ..., AN (if exist) will in the range of [-1, 100].
Length of A is in the range of [1, 1000].
B is in the range of [1, 100].

The following solution is based on that:

If there are two path to reach n, and they have the same optimal cost, then the longer path is lexicographically smaller.

Proof by contradiction:
Assume path P and Q have the same cost, and P is strictly shorter and P is lexicographically smaller.
Since P is lexicographically smaller, P and Q must start to differ at some point.
In other words, there must be i in P and j in Q such that i < j and len([1...i]) == len([1...j])
P = [1...i...n]
Q = [1...j...n]
Since i is further away from n there need to be no less steps taken to jump from i to n unless j to n is not optimal
So len([i...n]) >= len([j...n])
So len(P) >= len(Q) which contradicts the assumption that P is strictly shorter.

For example:
Input: [1, 4, 2, 2, 0], 2
Path P = [1, 2, 5]
Path Q = [1, 3, 4, 5]
They both have the same cost 4 to reach n
They differ at i = 2 in P and j = 3 in Q
Here Q is longer but not lexicographically smaller.
Why? Because j = 3 to n = 5 is not optimal.
The optimal path should be [1, 3, 5] where the cost is only 2
