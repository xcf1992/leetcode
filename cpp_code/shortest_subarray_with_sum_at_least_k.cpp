862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K

Return the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of A with sum at least K.
If there is no non-empty subarray with sum at least K, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: A = [1], K = 1
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: A = [1,2], K = 4
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: A = [2,-1,2], K = 3
Output: 3

Note:
1 <= A.length <= 50000
-10 ^ 5 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 5
1 <= K <= 10 ^ 9

We can rephrase this as a problem about the prefix sums of A. Let P[i] = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i-1].
We want the smallest y-x such that y > x and P[y] - P[x] >= K.

Motivated by that equation, let opt(y) be the largest x such that P[x] <= P[y] - K. We need two key observations:

If x1 < x2 and P[x2] <= P[x1],
then opt(y) can never be x1,
as if P[x1] <= P[y] - K,
then P[x2] <= P[x1] <= P[y] - K but y - x2 is smaller.
This implies that our candidates x for opt(y) will have increasing values of P[x].

If opt(y1) = x,
then we do not need to consider this x again.
For if we find some y2 > y1
with opt(y2) = x,
then it represents an answer of y2 - x which is worse (larger) than y1 - x.

Algorithm

Maintain a "monoqueue" of indices of P:
a deque of indices x_0, x_1, ...
such that P[x_0], P[x_1], ... is increasing.

When adding a new index y,
we'll pop x_i from the end of the deque
so that P[x_0], P[x_1], ..., P[y] will be increasing.

If P[y] >= P[x_0] + K,
then (as previously described),
we don't need to consider this x_0 again,
and we can pop it from the front of the deque.

Calculate prefix sum B of list A.
B[j] - B[i] represents the sum of subarray A[i] ~ A[j-1]
Deque d will keep indexes of increasing B[i].
For every B[i], we will compare B[i] - B[d[0]] with K.

Time Complexity:
Loop on B O(N)
Every index will be pushed only once into deque. O(N)

Q: How to think of such solutions?
A: Basic idea, for array starting at every A[i], find the shortest one with sum at leat K.
In my solution, for B[i], find the smallest j that B[j] - B[i] >= K.
Keep this in mind for understanding two while loops.

Q: What is the purpose of first while loop?
A: For the current prefix sum B[i], it covers all subarray ending at A[i-1].
We want know if there is a subarray, which starts from an index, ends at A[i-1] and has at least sum K.
So we start to compare B[i] with the smallest prefix sum in our deque, which is B[D[0]], hoping that [i] - B[d[0]] >= K.
So if B[i] - B[d[0]] >= K, we can update our result res = min(res, i - d.popleft()).
The while loop helps compare one by one, until this condition isn't valid anymore.

Q: Why we pop left in the first while loop?
A: This the most tricky part that improve my solution to get only O(N).
D[0] exists in our deque, it means that before B[i], we didn't find a subarray whose sum at least K.
B[i] is the first prefix sum that valid this condition.
In other words, A[D[0]] ~ A[i-1] is the shortest subarray starting at A[D[0]] with sum at least K.
We have already find it for A[D[0]] and it can't be shorter, so we can drop it from our deque.

Q: What is the purpose of second while loop?
A: To keep B[D[i]] increasing in the deque.

Q: Why keep the deque increase?
A: If B[i] <= B[d.back()] and moreover we already know that i > d.back(), it means that compared with d.back(),
B[i] can help us make the subarray length shorter and sum bigger. So no need to keep d.back() in our deque.
