1697. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths
https://leetcode.com/problems/checking-existence-of-edge-length-limited-paths/

An undirected graph of n nodes is defined by edgeList,
where edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi with distance disi.
Note that there may be multiple edges between two nodes.

Given an array queries, where queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj],
your task is to determine for each queries[j] whether there is a path between pj and qj
such that each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than limitj .

Return a boolean array answer,
where answer.length == queries.length
and the jth value of answer is true if there is a path for queries[j] is true, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8],[1,0,16]], queries = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.
For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.
For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.

Example 2:
Input: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1,10],[1,2,5],[2,3,9],[3,4,13]], queries = [[0,4,14],[1,4,13]]
Output: [true,false]
Exaplanation: The above figure shows the given graph.

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 105
edgeList[i].length == 3
queries[j].length == 3
0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n - 1
ui != vi
pj != qj
1 <= disi, limitj <= 109
There may be multiple edges between two nodes.

Observation
The key here is to notice that the queries are offline
which means that we can reorganize them however we want.

Now to answer the question,
whether there is a path between any two nodes
where the maximum edge length or weight is less than limit,
we can join all the edges whose weight is less than limit
and if we are still not able to reach one node from the other it essentially
means that there is no path between them where edge weight is less than limit.

Which is the best data structure that can help us join edges as we want
and answer whether in that structure,
node a and node b are connected ?
That's right! DSU.

Let's try and use these facts to solve the question.

Solution
First we need to sort the input queries and edgeList by edge length or weight.
We can now simply use a two pointer approach to Union all the nodes whose edges have weight less than query[i].
To know if there is a path between them all we need is to know whether their parents (in DSU) are same.

            Rank[xset] < Rank[yset] ? Parent[xset] = yset : Parent[yset] = xset;
            Rank[xset] += Rank[xset] == Rank[yset];
            return true;
