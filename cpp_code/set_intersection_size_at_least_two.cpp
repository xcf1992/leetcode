 757. Set Intersection Size At Least Two
 An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a < b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.

 Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has size at least 2.

 Example 1:
 Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5]]
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.
 Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.
 Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.
 Example 2:
 Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5]]
 Output: 5
 Explanation:
 An example of a minimum sized set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
 Note:

 intervals will have length in range [1, 3000].
 intervals[i] will have length 2, representing some integer interval.
 intervals[i][j] will be an integer in [0, 10^8].

 The greedy algorithm for constructing the minimum intersection set is not easy to come up with,
 as it replies on two properties of the minimum intersection set.
 In this post, I will explain what these properties are and how to find the size of the minimum intersection set using these properties.

 I -- Definitions and notations

 To ease the explanation, we first spell out some definitions and notations that will be used in this post.

 Intersection set: we define an intersection set for a given array (containing intervals) as a set S
 such that for every interval A in the given array, the intersection of S with A has size at least 2.

 Minimum intersection set: of all the intersection sets for a given array,
 let m be the minimum value of their sizes,
 then any one of the intersection sets with size m will be referred to as a minimum intersection set.

 Notations:
 let intervals be the input array with length n;
 intervals[0, i] denote the subarray containing intervals of indices from 0 up to i;
 S_i be the minimum intersection set for the subarray intervals[0, i];
 m_i be the size of S_i.

 II -- Properties of the minimum intersection set

 From the notations in part I,
 our goal is to figure out m_(n-1),
 the size of S_(n-1),
 which is the minimum intersection set for the whole input array.
 To apply the greedy algorithm, we need to take advantage of the following two properties of S_i:

 S_i does not depend on the order of the intervals in the subarray intervals[0, i].

 m_i is non-decreasing with increasing i, that is, we always have m_(i-1) <= m_i.

 The first property is straightforward from the definition of an intersection set,
 where the intersection requirement (i.e., intersection size >= 2) does not depend on the order of the intervals in the given array.

 The second property comes from the fact that if S_i is a minimum intersection set for subarray intervals[0, i],
 then it will also be an intersection set for subarray intervals[0, i-1]
 (but not necessarily a minimum intersection set).
 Since both S_(i-1) and S_i are intersection sets for the subarray intervals[0, i-1],
 but the former is a minimum intersection set, by definition we conclude: m_(i-1) <= m_i.

 III -- The greedy algorithm for constructing the minimum intersection set

 The first property above suggests we are free to rearrange the intervals in the input array,
 which means the intervals can be sorted to our advantage.
 There are two choices for sorting: we can sort the intervals either with ascending start points or with ascending end points.
 Both will work but here we will sort them with ascending end points,
 and if two intervals have the same end points,
 the one with larger start point will come first
 (we want to process the shorter interval before the longer one).

 The second property above suggests to minimize m_i, we need to minimize m_(i-1),
 which in turn requires minimization of m_(i-2), and so on.
 This is actually where the greedy idea comes from.
 So assume for now we have minimized m_(i-1), how can we minimize m_i?

 We know that m_(i-1) <= m_i, so the minimum value of m_i we can achieve is m_(i-1).
 If this is the case, what does it imply?
 It means S_(i-1) is not only a minimum intersection set for the subarray intervals[0, i-1],
 but also a minimum intersection set for the subarray intervals[0, i].
 This is equivalent to saying that we can find two different elements from S_(i-1) such that both elements intersect with the interval intervals[i].

 But how do we find such two elements?
 If the intervals come in arbitrary order,
 we probably have to check each element in S_(i-1) one by one and see if it intersects with intervals[i],
 which is rather inefficient.
 Fortunately, the intervals can be sorted.
 In our case, they are sorted in ascending order according to their end points.
 This means all elements in S_(i-1) will be no greater than the end point of the interval intervals[i].
 This is because every element e in S_(i-1) will intersect with at least one interval in the subarray intervals[0, i-1]
 (otherwise, we can remove e to make S_(i-1) smaller without violating the intersection requirement).
 Without loss of generality, assume the interval intersecting with e has index j,
 where 0 <= j <= i - 1 < i, then we have e <= intervals[j][1] <= intervals[i][1].

 Therefore we only need to check the largest two elements (denoted as largest and second) in S_(i-1) to see if they intersect with the interval intervals[i].
 This is because if they don't, other elements won't either.
 Note this also implies that of all the minimum intersection sets for the subarray intervals[0, i-1],
 we will choose S_(i-1) to be the one with its largest two elements maximized.
 That is, for the subarray intervals[0, i-1],
 we not only minimize the size of the intersection set,
 but also maximize its largest two elements (after the size is minimized).

 Checking if the largest two elements intersect with interval[i] is equivalent to comparing them with the start point of interval[i].

 There are three cases here:
 Case 1: both elements intersect with intervals[i].
         For this case, we show m_i = m_(i-1),
         and no updates are needed for the largest two elements of S_i.

 Case 2: only the largest element intersects with intervals[i].
         For this case, we show m_i = 1 + m_(i-1),
         and the largest two elements of S_i need to be updated.

 Case 3: neither of them intersects with intervals[i].
         For this case, we show m_i = 2 + m_(i-1),
         and the largest two elements of S_i need to be updated.

 Consider Case 1 first.
 From our analyses above, we know S_(i-1) is also a minimum intersection set for subarray intervals[0, i],
 therefore we can choose S_i to be the same as S_(i-1) and get m_i = m_(i-1).
 Can we make the largest two elements of S_i even larger?
 Negative. It is because if such a set S_i exists,
 it will also be a minimum intersection set for the subarray intervals[0, i-1],
 so its largest two elements cannot exceed those of S_(i-1)
 (note we've already chosen S_(i-1) to be the minimum intersection set for intervals[0, i-1] with the largest two elements maximized),
 contradicting the assumption.

 Consider Case 2 next.
 Can we still have m_i = m_(i-1)? Nope.
 If this is true, then S_i will also be a minimum intersection set for intervals[0, i-1],
 indicating its two largest elements won't exceed those of S_(i-1).
 Since the largest two elements of S_i intersect with intervals[i],
 the largest two elements of S_(i-1) must also intersect with intervals[i],
 contradicting the fact that only one of them intersects with intervals[i].
 Therefore we conclude: m_i >= 1 + m_(i-1).
 Can we have m_i = 1 + m_(i-1)? Yes.
 S_i can be constructed by simply adding the end point of intervals[i] to S_(i-1).
 This not only makes S_i a minimum intersection set for the subarray intervals[0, i],
 but also maximizes its largest two elements.

 Consider Case 3 last.
 Can we have either m_i = m_(i-1) or m_i = 1 + m_(i-1)? No,
 with the same reasoning in Case 2.
 So we conclude: m_i >= 2 + m_(i-1).
 Can we have m_i = 2 + m_(i-1)? Yes.
 S_i can be constructed by simply adding the end point and the point immediately before the end point of intervals[i] to S_(i-1).
 This will turn S_i into a minimum intersection set for the subarray intervals[0, i], meanwhile maximize its largest two elements.

 For all the three cases, S_i is constructed in such a way that its size is minimized first,
 then its largest two elements are maximized.
 When all the intervals are processed,
 S_(n-1) will be a minimum intersection set of the whole input array and m_(n-1) is the minimum size we are looking for.
