793. Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function

Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!.
(Recall that x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x, and by convention, 0! = 1.)

For example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end,
while f(11) = 2 because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end.
Given K, find how many non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = K.

Example 1:
Input: K = 0
Output: 5
Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with K = 0 zeroes.

Example 2:
Input: K = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no x such that x! ends in K = 5 zeroes.

Note:
K will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].

Since the steps of the jump may be greater than 1,
not all integer values can be taken by K.

For example, K cannot be 5 as the step at x = 25 is two so K will jump from 4 directly to 6,
thus skip the middle value of 5 (see the red dashed line between two brown lines in the above plot).

We shall call these skipped integers as invalid values for K
and conclude there are NO integers x such that x! has K trailing zeros at these K values.

Furthermore, for each valid K value, there will be exactly FIVE integers x such that x! has K trailing zeros
(this is because if x is an integer multiple of 5, then x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4 will have no factor of 5,
thus the jump step at each of these points will be 0, which implies K will remain the same in the range [x, x+4]).
In summary, we conclude the number of integers x such that x! has K trailing zeros will be either 0 or 5,
where the former corresponds to invalid K values while the latter corresponds to valid K values.

As a direct result of the above observation, all the valid K values will form an ordered list of ranges
where each range consists of 5 continuous integers, i.e., the valid K values are: [0, 5), [6, 11), [12, 17), …, etc.
The K values will break up whenever x is an integer multiple of 25
and the size(i.e., number of elements) of the gap between the two separated ranges
will be given by the number of factor 5 in x minus 1
(note it’s the number of factor minus 1, not x, and is equivalent to the number of factor 5 in x/5).

Let K = numOfTrailingZeros(x), then K will jump whenever x is an integer multiple of 5
(this is a direct result of the fact that the number of factor 5 in x! will change whenever x is an integer multiple of 5).
The step of the jump will be given by the number of factor 5 in x (no factorial).
For example, K will jump by 1 step at x = 5, 10, 15, 20, but by 2 steps at 25, as demonstrated in the following plot:

This solution takes advantage of the last observation mentioned above,
where we use binary search to find the largest integers x and y such that numOfTrailingZeros(x) <= K
and numOfTrailingZeros(y) <= K-1, respectively.
Then the factorial of all integers in the range (y, x] (left exclusive, right inclusive) will have K trailing zeros.
Therefore the total number of non-negative integers whose factorials have K trailing zeros will be given by x - y.

The following is the Java code for this solution, where the time complexity is O((logK)^2)
and space complexity is O(1).
Note that x! will always have at least x/5 trailing zeros,
therefore, if y is the largest integer such that y! has no more than K trailing zeros,
then we have y <= 5 * (K + 1), which can serve as the upper bound of our binary search.
