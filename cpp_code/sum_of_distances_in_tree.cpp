834. Sum of Distances in Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/

An undirected, connected tree with N nodes labelled 0...N-1 and N-1 edges are given.
The ith edge connects nodes edges[i][0] and edges[i][1] together.
Return a list ans, where ans[i] is the sum of the distances between node i and all other nodes.

Example 1:
Input: N = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
Explanation:
Here is a diagram of the given tree:
  0
 / \
1   2
   /|\
  3 4 5
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.

Note:
1 <= N <= 10000

Let ans be the returned answer, so that in particular ans[x] be the answer for node x.

Naively, finding each ans[x] would take O(N) time (where N is the number of nodes in the graph), which is too slow.
This is the motivation to find out how ans[x] and ans[y] are related, so that we cut down on repeated work.

Let's investigate the answers of neighboring nodes x and y.
In particular, say xy is an edge of the graph,
that if cut would form two trees XX(containing x) and Y (containing y).

Then, as illustrated in the diagram,
the answer for x in the entire tree, is the answer of x on X "x@X",
plus the answer of y on Y "y@Y",
plus the number of nodes in Y "#(Y)".
The last part "#(Y)" is specifically because for any node z in Y, dist(x, z) = dist(y, z) + 1.

By similar reasoning,
the answer for y in the entire tree is ans[y] = x@X + y@Y + #(X).
Hence, for neighboring nodes x and y, ans[x] - ans[y] = #(Y) - #(X).

When we move our root from one node to its connected node, one part of nodes get closer, one the other part get further.
If we know exactly hom many nodes in both parts, we can solve this problem.

With one single traversal in tree, we should get enough information for it and don't need to do it again and again.

Explanation:
0. Let's solve it with node 0 as root.

Initial an array of hashset tree, tree[i] contains all connected nodes to i.
Initial an array count, count[i] counts all nodes in the subtree i.
Initial an array of res, res[i] counts sum of distance in subtree i.

Post order dfs traversal, update count and res:
count[root] = sum(count[i]) + 1
res[root] = sum(res[i]) + sum(count[i])

Pre order dfs traversal, update res:
When we move our root from parent to its child i, count[i] points get 1 closer to root, n - count[i] nodes get 1 futhur to root.
res[i] = res[root] - count[i] + N - count[i]

return res, done.

Time Complexity:
dfs: O(N)
dfs2: O(N)
