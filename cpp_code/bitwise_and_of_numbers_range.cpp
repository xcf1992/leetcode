201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range
https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/

Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647,
return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:
Input: [5,7]
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: [0,1]
Output: 0

The idea is very simple:

last bit of (odd number & even number) is 0.
when m != n, There is at least an odd number and an even number, so the last bit position result is 0.
Move m and n rigth a position.
Keep doing step 1,2,3 until m equal to n, use a factor to record the iteration time.

The hardest part of this problem is to find the regular pattern.
For example, for number 26 to 30
Their binary form are:
11010
11011
11100
11101
11110

Because we are trying to find bitwise AND,
so if any bit there are at least one 0 and one 1, it always 0. In this case, it is 11000.
So we are go to cut all these bit that they are different.
In this case we cut the right 3 bit.
I think after understand this, the code is trivial:
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        int i = 0;
        for (; m != n; i++) {
            m >>= 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return m << i;
    }
};
