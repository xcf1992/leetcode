1197. Minimum Knight Moves
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/

In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity,
you have a knight at square [0, 0].

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make,
as illustrated below.
Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction,
then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y].
It is guaranteed the answer exists.

Example 1:
Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]

Example 2:
Input: x = 5, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]

Constraints:
|x| + |y| <= 300

While the O(1) math solution is impressive,
it is unlikely that you will come up with such solution on a real interview unless you knew it beforehand.

Here's an iterative solution divided into 2 zones:
"near zone" (within 2 squares distance for both coordinates),
and "far zone", (greater than 2 squares distance for at least one coordinate).

While in the "far" zone,
jump to reduce the coordinate with the greater value.

In the "near" zone, since the square {0,0} is black,
you can jump to it from a white square in 1 move,
and from a black square in 2 moves.
The symmetry makes conditionals shorter if you take the absolute value.

There are 2 edge cases: the same square (0 moves),
and an adjacent square (3 moves).
